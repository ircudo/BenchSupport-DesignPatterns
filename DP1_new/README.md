## Abstract Factory [additional] Example 

In this example, 
- `Food` is an abstract class that defines the basic properties and behavior of food. 
- `Pasta` and `Pizza` are concrete classes that extend the Food class and implement their own version of the cook method.

- `FoodFactory` is an interface that defines the methods for creating food. 
  - `ItalianFoodFactory` and `MexicanFoodFactory` are concrete classes that implement the FoodFactory interface 
  and provide their own implementation of the createFood method.

- `The AbstractFactoryPatternDemo` class is the client code that demonstrates how to use the abstract factory pattern to create different types of food from different food factories. 
- In this example, we create spaghetti and margherita pizza from the ItalianFoodFactory, and chickenFajita pizza from the MexicanFoodFactory. 
- Each food item is cooked using its own cook method.

Note that the MexicanFoodFactory does not create pasta because it is not a popular dish in Mexican cuisine. 
This demonstrates how the abstract factory pattern can be used to create different variations of objects based on certain conditions or requirements.
